--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This modelling study aims to quantify the expansion of the dengue transmission zone in Brazil and understand the drivers of this expansion using spatio-temporal additive models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A description of each file and folder is provided below:

  **01_exploratory_plots.R:** `R` script to explore and visualise dengue, socioeconomic, climate, and connectivity data.

  **02_model_fitting.R:** `R` script used to fit spatio-temporal models.

  **03_model_output.R:** `R` script to explore and visualise model output.
  
  **data:** a folder containing databases necessary to create the visualisations provided in the manuscript and fit the spatio-temporal models.
  
  **output:** a folder to save the output generated by the `R` scripts.

The analysis was performed using R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10).
